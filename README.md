# Backbone-Testing
================

## Purpose
Demonstrate ways to test Backbone applications in the browser. RequireJS is the AMD loader. Several testing frameworks will be evaluated.

## Jasmine
Status: Done

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.
